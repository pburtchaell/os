# os

This is a set of scripts to install the tools I use on a daily basis for design and development work on macOS.

## Getting Started

To install and configure everything, just run this line in terminal:

```
sh ./setup.sh
```

## What's Included

### macOS Setup

This sets reasonable defaults and settings for macOS.

### Design Tools

Instead of downloading design tools, it's possible to install them with Homebrew.

The following software is installed:

- [Framer Studio](https://framer.com/)
- [Origami Studio](https://origami.design/)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/)

### Development Tools

#### Homebrew

Homebrew is "the missing package manager for macOS." It enables me to install a lot of software from the command line.

#### Node

The stable version of Node is installed via nvm and set to the default. The following tools are also installed:

- [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): Version manager for Node
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): Fast dependency manager
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app): React starter app
- [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app): React Native starter app
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): React static site generator

#### Ruby

The stable version of Ruby is installed via rvm. The following tools are also installed:

- [Ruby on Rails]():
- [Foreman]():

### Other Software

## But wait, that's not all!

The scripts can't handle everything, unfortunately. Here's a few other things to do.

### Atom Editor

Install the following plugins:

- [linter]()
- [linter-eslint]()

Also make sure to setup the GitHub integration so you can see pull requests in the editor.
